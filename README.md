# Hyperledger Umbra

An emulation platform for Hyperledger blockchains.

To understand and run Umbra, please take a look at the [Umbra Docs](https://umbra-labs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Also, if needed download an [Umbra virtual machine](https://intrig.dca.fee.unicamp.br:8840/owncloud/index.php/s/aKYbP8TxlxymRHY). 
To use the Umbra virtual machine, login: umbra / password: lives . 

This project is the outcome of the 2019 [internship project named Hyperledger Umbra](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Umbra%3A+Simulating+Hyperledger+Blockchains+using+Mininet).

This lab is intended to be an ongoing project to provide a research tool for understanding and improving the Hyperledger blockchain platforms as well as for conducting future research in consensus algorithms and scalability.

This lab is not intended to be a shipping product but rather an ongoing collaboration between academic, corporate, and hobbyist researchers improving upon existing capabilities and also trying new things with Hyperledger blockchains.
